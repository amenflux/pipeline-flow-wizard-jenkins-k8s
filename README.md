# Pipeline Flow Wizard

I've created a Pipeline Flow Wizard that guides users through setting up a complete Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with Docker and Kubernetes. The app features a step-by-step interface with customizable configuration files and a visual pipeline representation.

## Features:

This project is a Kubernetes GitOps Pipeline demonstration application that showcases how GitOps principles can be used to automate Kubernetes deployments. The application provides a visual and educational overview of the complete workflow from code changes to deployment.

This project can be used to automate:
* Continuous Deployment to Kubernetes - Any changes pushed to the Git repository trigger automatic validation and deployment to the Kubernetes cluster
* Multi-environment Deployments - Support for different environments (staging, production) with environment-specific configurations
* Application Lifecycle Management - Automated rolling updates, scaling, and health monitoring
* Configuration Management - Version-controlled application configurations with GitOps principles
* Infrastructure as Code - Declarative approach to define and version the entire application stack

The templates provided can be customized to create real-world GitOps pipelines by replacing placeholders with actual values specific to your infrastructure and applications.

## Project Objective

The main objective is to demonstrate a complete DevOps pipeline using GitOps methodology with ArgoCD and Helm for Kubernetes deployments. It serves as an educational tool to help users understand how changes flow from Git repositories to Kubernetes clusters in an automated fashion.

## Additional Details

From examining the codebase, I can see:

1. Interactive Wizard Interface: The application offers a step-by-step wizard interface to guide users through setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline.
2. Key Components:
    * Repository Setup: Configuration for Git repositories
    * Jenkinsfile Setup: Jenkins pipeline configuration
    * Dockerfile Setup: Container image configuration
    * Kubernetes Setup: Kubernetes manifest configuration
    * Deployment Configuration: Settings for deploying to different environments
    * Monitoring Setup: Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana
3. Visual Pipeline Representation: The application includes a PipelineVisualizer component that provides a visual representation of the CI/CD workflow.
4. Export Functionality: Users can export their configurations as files
